Apolaki's Call is a semi-fantasy board and turn-based game with stylized visuals inspired by ancient Philippine mythology. The game's settings and characters are loosely based on real-life locations and legendary figures. Your objective is to explore an apocalyptic ancient world, gather the artifacts of Apolaki, and ultimately defeat the monstrous Bayawak to save the moon.

You start the game with full health, full mana, and equipped with the Headdress of Apolaki, which provides you with sun-based energy attacks and other special abilities. However, you have no weapons or shields to protect yourself at the beginning.
 
The game begins in the Candaba Swamp, a mysterious area that serves as your starting point. To reach the final battle, you'll need to navigate through three different locations, encountering various events along the way. The first area has 5 events, the second one has 3 events, and the last one has 2 events, which are randomly generated each playthrough. Movement through the areas is just pressing arrow buttons. 

Events in each area are categorized into two types: Blessing events and Combat events. Blessing events provide various rewards, such as a) special skills, b) defense buffs, or c) health restoration. Combat events require you to defeat mythical creatures to earn a) weapon upgrades or b) shield upgrades. During Blessing events, you have a chance to obtain an attack skill like Sun Strike or Solar Flare, a defense skill such as Sun Shield, or a healing boost to recover lost health. Combat events challenge you to defeat enemies rewarding you with artifact/s.

Combat follows a turn-based system. Use weapons for basic attacks, shields to reduce incoming damage, and special skills to turn the tide of battle. Mana regenerates by 10 points after every turn, allowing you to use special skills at regular intervals. You can hold up to 2 copies of any given special skill, which means strategy is key in deciding which skills to keep.

Be aware that enemies also have their own special skills and may sometimes ambush you, striking first in combat. Defensive skills are crucial for reducing damage in such cases, and some enemies might even defend themselves to counter your attacks.

Your journey leads you through various ancient landscapes and hidden temples, collecting the fragments of Apolaki's power. The ultimate goal is to reach the Midnight Sky, where the Bayawak resides. There, you'll engage in the final battle to protect the moon and restore balance to the ancient world. If you succeed, you'll be transported back to the modern world, returning to the museum just as the earthquake subsides, and you'll carry the wisdom of the past with you and know the truth about the museum personnelâ€™s past.
